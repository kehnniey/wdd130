        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Kehinde Ojo" width="200">
        <p>Hello, my name is Kehinde Ojo, and I reside in Coventry, Rhode Island. Being an identical twin,
           I often get mistaken for my brother, which leads to some amusing situations and unique experiences.
           I am the sole member of my family living in the US, which has taught me a great deal about independence,
           resilience, and the importance of staying connected with loved ones across distances. I take immense pleasure
           in watching soccer, enjoy gardening, and find fulfillment in serving others. These hobbies not only provide me
           with relaxation but also give me a sense of community and purpose. Additionally, 
           I am passionate about learning new skills and constantly seek opportunities for personal growth.
           I love reading, traveling to new places, and listening to gospel music, which enriches my life and broadens
           my perspectives. My dedication to helping others extends beyond my personal life, as I actively volunteer
           in local community projects and initiatives, striving to make a positive impact wherever I can.    
        </p>
